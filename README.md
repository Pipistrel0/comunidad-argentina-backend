# Backend Comunidad Argentina

**Version: 0.0.1**

This is a practice project and the first version for the backend of the website "Comunidad Argentina".

The idea of the project is to make a single web page where people can post help articles, charity articles, etc. Basically articles/posts to people and the comunities that needs help. Other idea I have is to post across social networks. An example of this is if you make a post on Twitter you can share that post to the website or vice versa. This will help to only make one post and share it between social networks. I will implement the open autherization standar to make easier the login and sign-up of the website.

The backend will consist of nodejs with some libraries like express, passportjs and mongoose.
